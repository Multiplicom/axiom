Axiom
=====
Axiom is an HTML5/JavaScript library for dynamic layouting and rendering of graphical elements on a web browser page, such as tables, plots and controls.

It can be used to build a graphical user interface for rich, interactive web applications,
mimicking the GUI patterns of a traditional desktop application.

Webpack & npm
=============
This branch attempts to bundle Axiom, producing artefacts that can be published as an npm package. This npm packaged library can than be used as a part of a "modern" Javascript development stack, using npm as a package manager and Webpack as a Client App bundler.
